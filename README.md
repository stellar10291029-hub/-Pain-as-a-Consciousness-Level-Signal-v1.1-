# Pain as a Consciousness-Level Signal (v1.1)

This repository presents **Pain as a Consciousness-Level Signal** —
a conceptual interface that interprets pain not as a biomedical symptom,
but as a **first-order signal of misalignment** within the human
consciousness–body system.For canonical prior-art and version anchoring, see the Prior-Art Reference at the end of this document.

This work translates a prior-art declaration into an
**engineering-readable conceptual layer** suitable for
Human-Centered AI, safety-oriented systems, and narrative-aware interfaces.

---

## What This Is
- A **signal interpretation framework**
- A **conceptual interface**, not an algorithm
- A **non-prescriptive, non-intervention layer**

Pain is treated as:
> a state signal emitted when lived structure and intrinsic orientation
> of consciousness diverge.

---

## What This Is NOT
-  A medical treatment protocol
-  A diagnostic or optimization system
-  A predictive or decision-making engine

This framework **intentionally interrupts action**, rather than guiding it.

---

## Core Concept (v1.1)
Pain operates as a **consciousness-level signal** with the following properties:

- **Persistence** – the signal remains until misalignment is addressed
- **Directionality** – the signal points toward unresolved meaning
- **Intensity** – reflects compression of unsymbolized experience

Pain ≠ error to be removed  
Pain = **state information to be interpreted**

---

## Conceptual Interface

### Input (Human State)
- Lived experience
- Narrative compression
- Emotional / identity / survival load
- Responsibility imbalance

### Signal
- Pain intensity
- Pain persistence
- Pain recurrence pattern

### Output (System-Level Effect)
- Meaning interruption
- Decision pause
- Narrative re-evaluation

No optimization is performed.
No action is prescribed.

---

## Intended Use Cases
- Human-Centered AI (HCAI)
- Safety & decision-interruption layers
- Narrative decoding tools
- Wellbeing-aware UX systems
- AI–human boundary design

## Relation to PKF
This work is conceptually aligned with the **Pain Kernel Framework (PKF)**,
which defines pain as a minimal unit of meaning-processing.
The present repository focuses specifically on
**signal-level interpretation** rather than kernel decomposition.

---

## Prior-Art Reference
This repository is a conceptual translation of the prior-art declaration.
It represents a v1.1 extended interpretive implementation, while the Zenodo record
remains the canonical v1.0 declaration.
