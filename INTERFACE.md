# Conceptual Interface: Pain as a Consciousness-Level Signal (v1.1)

This document specifies a **conceptual interface** for interpreting pain
as a consciousness-level signal. It defines inputs, signal properties,
and system-level effects without prescribing actions or optimizations.

---

## Design Principle
- Non-prescriptive
- Non-predictive
- Non-intervention by default
- Interruption over optimization

The interface exists to **pause decisions**, not to drive them.

---

## System Boundary
This interface operates at the **interpretation layer** between:
- Human lived experience
- Meaning-processing (consciousness)
- System awareness (AI / UX / safety layers)

It does not perform diagnosis or treatment.

---

## Input: Human State Variables

The interface receives **qualitative state descriptors**, not numeric labels.

- Lived experience state (contextual)
- Narrative compression (unsymbolized experience)
- Emotional load
- Identity strain
- Survival pressure
- Responsibility imbalance

Inputs may be inferred, observed, or self-reported.

---

## Signal: Pain Properties

Pain is interpreted as a signal with three core properties:

1. **Intensity**
   - Degree of compression or unresolved meaning
2. **Persistence**
   - Duration of signal without resolution
3. **Directionality**
   - Indicates presence of misalignment, not solution path

Pain does not encode instructions.
It encodes **state misalignment information**.

---

## Output: System-Level Effects

Upon signal detection, the interface produces **effects**, not actions:

- Meaning interruption
- Decision pause
- Narrative re-evaluation trigger
- Awareness escalation

No optimization, ranking, or recommendation is generated.

---

## Forbidden Operations
The following are intentionally excluded:

- Action recommendation
- Behavior optimization
- Outcome prediction
- Risk scoring
- Compliance enforcement

Any system using this interface must preserve **human agency**.

---

## Interface Summary

Input:
- Human experiential state

Signal:
- Pain as state information

Output:
- Interruption and reflection capacity

This interface is compatible with Human-Centered AI,
safety-oriented systems, and narrative-aware designs.
