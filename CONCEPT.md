# Conceptual Foundation: Pain as a Consciousness-Level Signal (v1.1)

This document articulates the conceptual foundation of interpreting pain
as a consciousness-level signal, and clarifies its relationship to the
Pain Kernel Framework (PKF).

This is a **definition-level document**, not a theory or method.

## Conceptual Position

Pain is defined here as a **first-order signal** emitted when the
meaning-processing structure of consciousness becomes misaligned
with lived bodily or existential conditions.

Pain is not:
- a symptom to be eliminated
- a variable to be optimized
- a metric to be scored

Pain is:
- **state information**
- **misalignment signal**
- **interruption trigger**

---

## Why "Consciousness-Level"

Pain is elevated to the consciousness level because:

- It persists beyond nociceptive input
- It reorganizes attention, identity, and narrative
- It resists purely mechanistic explanation

At this level, pain functions as a **global signal**, not a local error.

---

## Relationship to the Pain Kernel Framework (PKF)

The Pain Kernel Framework (PKF) defines pain as a **minimal unit of
meaning-processing** within human experience.

This work operates at a different layer:

- PKF: Kernel-level decomposition of pain as meaning unit
- This work: **Signal-level interpretation of pain as system alert**

The relationship can be summarized as:

> PKF explains *what pain is made of*  
> Pain-as-Signal explains *what pain does*

They are complementary, not hierarchical.

## Signal vs. Intervention

A critical distinction of this framework is the separation between
**signal interpretation** and **intervention**.

- Signal interpretation: Allowed
- Intervention / optimization: Explicitly excluded

This separation preserves:
- human agency
- ethical boundaries
- non-automation of suffering

---

## Conceptual Guarantees

Any system referencing this framework must guarantee:

- No automatic action upon pain detection
- No prediction of outcomes
- No optimization of pain signals
- No replacement of human judgment

Pain must remain a **stop condition**, not a control input.

---

## Scope and Limits

This framework:
- Applies across medicine, AI, UX, and ethics
- Is intentionally non-operational
- Serves as a **boundary definition**

It defines where systems must stop,
not where they should proceed.
