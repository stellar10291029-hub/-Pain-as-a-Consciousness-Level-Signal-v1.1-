# Use Cases: Pain as a Consciousness-Level Signal (v1.1)

This document outlines **conceptual use cases** for integrating the
pain-as-signal interface into systems without prescribing implementation.

---

## 1. Human-Centered AI (HCAI)

### Scenario
An AI system detects indicators of sustained user distress.

### Role of Interface
- Interprets pain as a **state signal**
- Triggers a **decision pause**
- Prevents premature optimization or advice

### Outcome
The system refrains from action and preserves user agency.

---

## 2. Safety & Decision-Interruption Layers

### Scenario
High-stakes decision context (medical, legal, operational).

### Role of Interface
- Uses pain persistence as a **stop condition**
- Interrupts automated escalation

### Outcome
Human review is prioritized over automated execution.

---

## 3. Narrative Decoding Tools

### Scenario
Users describe experiences with repetitive pain narratives.

### Role of Interface
- Identifies narrative compression patterns
- Flags unresolved meaning without interpretation

### Outcome
Supports reflection without imposing meaning.

---

## 4. Wellbeing-Aware UX Systems

### Scenario
A platform detects user disengagement linked to distress.

### Role of Interface
- Treats pain as **contextual signal**, not error
- Avoids engagement optimization

### Outcome
UX respects limits instead of driving retention.

---

## 5. AI–Human Boundary Design

### Scenario
AI systems approach domains involving suffering or identity.

### Role of Interface
- Establishes a **non-intervention boundary**
- Signals when AI must stop influencing outcomes

### Outcome
Ethical boundary enforcement without moral judgment.

---

## Summary
Across use cases, the interface serves one function:
**to interrupt action when pain signals misalignment**.

It does not solve pain.
It preserves the space in which humans can.
