# One-Page Overview: Pain as a Consciousness-Level Signal

This page provides a **single-screen summary** of the framework for
engineers, designers, and system architects.

---

## Core Definition

Pain is a **consciousness-level signal** indicating misalignment between
lived experience and meaning-processing structures.

It is not an error to be fixed.
It is a signal that **forces a pause**.

---

## System Placement

Pain operates at the boundary between:

Human Experience → Consciousness → System Awareness

It does not belong inside control or optimization loops.

## Conceptual Flow Diagram

Human State
(lived experience,
narrative load,
identity strain)
        │
        ▼
Pain Signal
(intensity,
persistence,
recurrence)
        │
        ▼
Interruption Layer
(decision pause,
meaning suspension)
        │
        ▼
Human Responsibility
(reflection,
reinterpretation)

No automatic action is permitted beyond interruption.

## Allowed vs. Forbidden (At a Glance)

Allowed:
- Signal detection
- State awareness
- Decision interruption
- Human escalation

Forbidden:
- Action recommendation
- Optimization
- Scoring or ranking
- Predictive control

---

## Why This Matters for Engineering

Without this boundary:
- Pain becomes data
- Suffering becomes fuel
- Systems optimize harm

With this boundary:
- Systems know when to stop
- Responsibility stays human
- Ethical failure modes are reduced

---

## Minimal Compliance Rule

If pain is detected:
> **The system must pause, not proceed.**

This rule supersedes performance metrics.
